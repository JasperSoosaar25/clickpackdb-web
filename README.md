# ClickpackDB ✦ GD Click Sounds

A clean, community-driven database of **Geometry Dash clickpacks**  
Fast API, clean sounds, cyan vibes ✨

🌐 **Live website:**  
👉 https://clickpackdb.xyz

## 🟢 Site status

**LIVE — and actively being improved**

The website is **fully live and usable right now**:
- clickpacks are visible
- downloads work
- submissions work
- the API (`db.json`) is public

At the same time, this project is **actively being developed**, which means:
- the UI may change
- features may be added or adjusted
- layouts and visuals may be tweaked
- new automation may be introduced

If something looks different from one day to the next, that’s expected :3

## 📦 What this project does

- Hosts a public clickpack database
- Accepts community submissions via GitHub Issues
- Automatically processes and stores clickpacks
- Re-hosts files directly in this repository
- Exposes everything through a simple JSON API
- Displays clickpacks on a GitHub Pages website

Clickpacks shown on the site come from:
- the **official ClickpackDB repository**
- **this repository’s community submissions**

Both sources are merged into one clean list on the site ✨

## ➕ Submitting a clickpack

You can submit a clickpack here:

👉 https://github.com/JasperSoosaar25/clickpackdb-web/issues/new?template=clickpack.yml

How it works:
1. Open a new issue (make sure to choose "Clickpack submission" not "Blank issue" if not following the link above!!!:333)
2. Upload your `.zip` file directly (drag & drop or click “Paste, drop, or click to add files” below of the "Upload your clickpack ZIP" section)
3. Fill in the details
4. Submit

A bot will:
- download the uploaded ZIP
- store it permanently in this repository
- update the database
- make it available on the site automatically 💙

No external hosting required.
