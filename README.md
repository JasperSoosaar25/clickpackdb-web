# ClickpackDB ✦ GD Click Sounds

A clean, community-driven database of **Geometry Dash clickpacks**  
Fast API, clean sounds, cyan vibes ✨

🌐 **Live site:**

## 🚧 Site status

**🟢 Live, but actively being worked on!**

The website is online and usable right now, but it’s **constantly evolving**.
You might see:
- UI changes
- new features
- layout tweaks
- new clickpacks being added automatically

If something looks slightly different one day — that’s intentional :3

---

## 📦 What this is

- A public clickpack database
- Community submissions via GitHub Issues
- Automatic processing & updates
- One simple API (`db.json`)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

Clickpacks are fetched from:
- the **official ClickpackDB**
- **this repository’s community submissions**

Both are merged into one clean view on the site ✨

---

## ➕ Submitting a clickpack

You can submit a clickpack here:

👉 https://github.com/JasperSoosaar25/clickpackdb-web/issues/new?template=clickpack.yml

Once submitted:
- a bot processes it
- updates the database
- and it appears on the site automatically 💙
